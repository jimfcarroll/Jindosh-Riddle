Jinsoh Riddle Solver

This is a brute force solution to the Jindosh Riddle. WHAT? You don't know what the Jindosh Riddle is?

Well. Not your fault unless you're into first person stealth games. It's a riddle from chapter 6 of
the game Dishonored 2. Solving it allows you to skip the "Dust District" and get the achievement “Eureka!” If you’re a completionist and know groovy (you need to edit the beginning of the script to supply it the riddle specifics of your playthrough since they’re randomized) you might be able to use this. It's somewhat pointless though. See below.

It turns out, there are multiple solutions if you consider a solution a complete combination of all 6 attributes but the game only requires the correct combination of names and heirlooms.

Considering that the game only expects you to match the heirloom with the name and that the position doesn't matter, you only need to try all permitations of a set of 5 heirlooms. That's 120 permutations (5!). This is made even easier because one line of the riddle explicitly states that one particular person owns one particular heirloom. Therefore there's only all permitations of the set of 4 remaining heirlooms. So there's only 24 (4!) possibilities to brute force through.

Of course, if I had known that I wouldn't have written this but oh well, a couple hours down the drain.

No warranty implied or given.
