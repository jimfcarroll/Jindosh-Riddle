Jinsoh Riddle Solver

This is a brute force solution to the Jindosh Riddle. WHAT? You don't know what the Jindosh Riddle is?

Well. Not your fault unless you're into first person stealth games. It's a riddle from chapter 6 of
the game Dishonored 2. Solving it allows you to skip the "Dust District" and get the achievement “Eureka!” If you’re a completionist and know groovy (you need to edit the beginning of the script
to supply it the riddle specifics of your playthrough since they’re randomized.

It turns out, there are multiple solutions if you consider a solution a complete combination of all 6 attributes but the game only requires the correct combination of names and heirlooms.

Have fun. No warranty implied or given.
